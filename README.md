# IK1203 Networks and Communication


<h2>Course Contents</h2>

<p>The course covers the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flow control and error control: flow control (stop&amp;wait, sliding window), error detection and error handling, error correcting codes, retransmission (ARQ).</li>
  <li>Layered models: overview of OSI and TCP/IP.</li>
  <li>LAN (Local Area Network) and LAN-systems: topologies, access- techniques and protocols, token ring, Ethernet, wireless networks bridged networks, spanning tree computation and VLAN.</li>
  <li>Packet and circuit switching: WAN (Wide Area Network) and public networks, principles, characteristics and protocols.</li>
  <li>Internetworking and IP: design principles and building blocks, connection oriented vs. connectionless protocols, Internet routing and Internet Protocol (IP).</li>
  <li>Transport layer protocols: TCP, UDP.</li>
  <li>Communication models: "Client-server" and "peer-to-peer".</li>
  <li>Applications: DNS, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, Telnet mm.</li>
  <li>Network programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intended Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>The course aims to teach the fundamental concepts of networking and communication. After completing the course, students should be able to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe and explain the basic terminology used in networking and communication</li>
  <li>Analyse communication scenarios and application requirements, and explain what methods and algorithms are suitable to use for a desired communication service</li>
  <li>Explain, model and analyse the behaviour of networks using different methods for error control, flow control and congestion control, and predict how such a system will react in response to different events and conditions</li>
  <li>Explain the functions of protocols of the different layers of the Internet model, and how different layers interact with each other</li>
  <li>Explain and implement basic algorithms and mechanisms for error detection, error correction, flow control, congestion control and routing</li>
  <li>Design, implement and analyse the behaviour of basic Internet applications and their protocols</li>
  <li>Explain different functions and concepts concerning equipment for communication and networks</li>
  <li>Compute and/or approximate the performance of communication systems, and suggest improvements.</li>
</ol>
